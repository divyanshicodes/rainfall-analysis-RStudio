# Rainfall Analysis in RStudio

This project analyzes radar-based rainfall observations using the `rain` dataset. It includes data cleaning, outlier removal, aggregation, feature transformation, and exploratory visualizations to understand rainfall behavior across gauges.

### 🔍 Key Analysis Steps
• Loading and inspecting the dataset  
• Handling missing values  
• Identifying and removing duplicated rows  
• Histogram of gauge rainfall observations  
• Identifying extreme rainfall above world record (305 mm/hr)  
• Aggregating multiple time points by gauge using median values  
• Creating a new categorical variable for rain type  
• Visualizing rainfall distributions using barplots and boxplots  

### 🧰 Tools Used
• RStudio  
• Base R functions  

### 🎯 Goal
To explore rainfall patterns using radar measurements and build meaningful visual summaries of rain intensity.
