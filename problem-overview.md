# Problem Overview

This project uses radar-based rainfall measurements to investigate patterns, remove inconsistencies, and produce meaningful visual summaries.

## Objectives
• Load and inspect gauge-level radar data  
• Remove missing values and duplicated rows  
• Identify rainfall measurements exceeding world-record thresholds  
• Aggregate readings from multiple time points per gauge  
• Categorize rainfall intensity as Moderate, Heavy, or Violent  
• Visualize rainfall patterns using barplots and boxplots  

## Focus
To clean, transform, and analyze rainfall data using a structured exploratory framework in RStudio.
